        <p>According to wikipedia, the tabby cat is most notably known for its markings on it's head. This cat has the markings, thus it is a tabby cat. It's also not a breed, but instead a fur pattern<p>
        <p>I didn't know the last part, so that's pretty cool.</p>

        <h2>I found this dog online as well</h2>
        <h3>He's the same breed as my pet, that being an <b>Austrlian Shephred</b></h3>

        <p>These dogs ain't even from Austrlia, but instead California. They are herding dogs, so imagine these dogs on prairie fields in Western Movies<p>
        <p>I don't know why they named them Austrlian Sheperds. Wikipedia says they helped herd Austrlian Sheep. So I guess that's why</p>
