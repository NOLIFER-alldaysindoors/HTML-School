            <p>These dogs actually come in other colors other than black. Like red or blounde. Trainable to do almost anything. Although they shed alot during the summer. Be sure to groom these dogs if you get one.<p>
            <p>These dogs were bred to pull sleds, but last time I tried that the dog just stared at me. So I think you'll have to train them to pull you. I see these dogs everywhere, so they shouldn't cost too much. Lovely dog. My negbhior has one and never uses it's leash. </p>
