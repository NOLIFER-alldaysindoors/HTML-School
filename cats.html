            <h2>The Siberian  Forest Cat</h2>
            <h3>Many color varties, great in very cold climates</h3>

            <img src="Cats/BolshoiCAT.jpg" alt="Orange Siberan">

            <p>According to Wikipedia, this cat is a naturally bred. It has a very thick furcoat, which comes with the downside of it's heavy shedding. It comes from Siberia, which is in Russia.<p>
            <p>I don't think it had to tell us the last part. But this cat is pretty beautfiul in every color. I never had a problem with pets shedding, but if you do then you may not want to get this exquiste cat</p>

            <h2>The Ragdoll Cat</h2>
            <h3>An affectionate and clingy cat</h3>
            <hr>    
            <img src="Cats/RagdolCat.jpg" alt="Sitting Ragdoll">

            <p>These cats tpyially come in a white or white grey-black colors. Very adorable cats who love to spend time with humans. If you ask me, this is the perfect beginner cat for people who are used to dogs.<p>
            <p>I really enjoy these cats. Every breed I've seen has accepted my pets. They are without a doubt the most extroverted cats in my eyes. One of them even fell asleep on me, and it was the first time I met it.</p>
