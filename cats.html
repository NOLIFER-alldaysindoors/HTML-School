            <p>According to Wikipedia, this cat is a naturally bred. It has a very thick furcoat, which comes with the downside of it's heavy shedding. It comes from Siberia, which is in Russia.<p>
            <p>I don't think it had to tell us the last part. But this cat is pretty beautfiul in every color. I never had a problem with pets shedding, but if you do then you may not want to get this exquiste cat</p>
