                <h6>Dogs I like alot</h6>
        <p>There's a dog for everything to be honest. Some of my personal favorite "work dogs" are the following:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>St. Beneard: Rescueing people in snowy mountians</li>
                <li>Golden Retriver: Classic dog. Hunting and bringing back fowl</li>
                <li>"Wiener" Dachshund: Hunt badgers and other burrow living critters</li>
                <li>Greyhound: Chasing game and, less ethical, racing</li>
                </ul>
        <p>There are of course plenty of other dog breeds out there. I'll list more of my favorites</p>

        <h2>The Husky Dog</h2>
            <h3>Cold, active, and fast</h3>
            <hr>    
            <img src="Dogs/HuskyDOG.jpg" alt="Common Dog" class="respond">

            <p>These dogs actually come in other colors other than black. Like red or blounde. Trainable to do almost anything. Although they shed alot during the summer. Be sure to groom these dogs if you get one.<p>
            <p>These dogs were bred to pull sleds, but last time I tried that the dog just stared at me. So I think you'll have to train them to pull you. I see these dogs everywhere, so they shouldn't cost too much. Lovely dog. My negbhior has one and never uses it's leash. </p>

            <h2>The Border Collie Dog</h2>
            <h3>Smart herder</h3>
            <hr>    
            <img src="Dogs/Border_Collie_panting.jpg" alt="Smart Doggo" class="respond">

            <p>These dogs actually come in other colors other than black. Like dots or blounde and even brown. These dogs were bred in borders between Scotland and England. Thus the name, border collie. That's pretty clever. These dogs are also pretty smart and trainable<p>
            <p>I don't why, but I've always loved this dog breed. The pictures of them can be so silly. Are they the silliest of dogs? Maybe, though every breed of puppy is silly lol. Great farmer dog too.</p>

             <h1>How to Train a Dog</h1>
    <p>Dogs are loyal and loving, but sometimes they need help learning the ropes. Here’s how you can train your dog, step by step!</p>

    <h2>Assess the Dog's Comfort Level</h2>
    <p>Observe the dog from a distance to see how it reacts to people and its environment. Look for signs of anxiety or aggression and make sure your safety comes first. Some dogs need more time to adjust than others.</p>

    <h2>Create a Safe and Calm Environment</h2>
    <p>Set up a quiet, calm space for the dog. This area should have food, water, and a comfortable place to sleep. Make sure the environment is peaceful, so the dog feels safe and can relax.</p>

    <h2>Provide Consistent Meals</h2>
    <p>Set a regular feeding schedule. Feed the dog at the same time every day in the same place, but give it space to eat without any distractions. Consistency builds trust and security for the dog.</p>

    <h2>Let the Dog Come to You</h2>
    <p>When introducing yourself to a new dog, sit quietly and let the dog approach you at its own pace. Avoid making sudden movements or direct eye contact, as this can be intimidating. Let the dog initiate contact.</p>

    <h2>Gradual Human Interaction</h2>
    <p>Once the dog seems more comfortable, try extending your hand slowly for the dog to sniff. Don’t rush any interactions. Allow the dog to come to you when it’s ready. Treats and positive reinforcement will encourage trust.</p>

    <h2>Use a Calm, Soothing Voice</h2>
    <p>Speak to the dog in a soft and calming voice. Dogs respond well to positive reinforcement, so avoid raising your voice. Make sure the tone of your voice matches the behavior you want to encourage.</p>

    <h2>Increase Interaction Gradually</h2>
    <p>Start with short, low-pressure interactions. Play with toys or go for brief walks to build a bond. Gradually increase the time you spend together as the dog becomes more comfortable.</p>

    <h2>Let the Dog Set the Pace</h2>
    <p>Don’t force interactions with the dog. Always allow the dog to approach you when it feels comfortable. Watch for signs of stress or fear and back off if the dog shows signs of being overwhelmed.</p>

    <h2>Be Patient and Give Time</h2>
    <p>Training a dog, especially one that might be nervous or unfamiliar with people, can take time. Be patient, as results may take weeks or months. Celebrate small steps and build on each positive experience.</p>

    <h2>New Best Friend!</h2>
    <p>Man's best friend as they say. He will never leave your side</p>
