        <p>Foxes are intelligent, playful, and have been the subject of curiosity for centuries. Being in folktales from every part of the world, such as Japanese Kitsunes, or the deceitful fox in Europe, the fox has always been a part of mankind's curiosity. So it is only natural for them to eventually become pets for humans. Even if they are not domesticated, at least most of them.</p>

                    <h2>The Domesticated Fox</h2>

                    <p>The domesticated silver fox is one of the recent domestications of the fox. They were birthed out of an experiment in the USSR, started by Dmitry Belyayev, who later failed, and was restarted again by Lyudmila Trut in 1952. The experiment has been ongoing since, with the goals of studying how genetics play in the domestication of animals.</p>
                    <p>Foxes are in no way the most common of pet. However, some people still own some. There are many types of foxes beyound the domesticated Russian ones, such as the Fennec, Artic, Crab-Eating, and many more foxes. </p>

                    <h2>Fox Legality and Pros/Cons</h2>
                    <p>Foxes are adorable but require special care. They can be affectionate but are (mostly) not fully domesticated.</p>
                    
                    <section class="column">
                        <h3>Pros</h3>
                        <p>Cute and unique, the fox is a medium-sized animal. They talk in essentially giggles, and act like a dog. They are, however, more closely related to cats than they are dogs.</p>

                    <section class="column">
                        <h3>Cons</h3>
                        <p>They are a wild animal, with the exception of the Russian domesticated foxes. Their urine is extremely smelly and very difficult to remove, making potty training the fox a first priority.</p>
