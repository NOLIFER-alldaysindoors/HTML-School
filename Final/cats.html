            <p>According to Wikipedia, this cat is a naturally bred. It has a very thick furcoat, which comes with the downside of it's heavy shedding. It comes from Siberia, which is in Russia.<p>
            <p>I don't think it had to tell us the last part. But this cat is pretty beautfiul in every color. I never had a problem with pets shedding, but if you do then you may not want to get this exquiste cat</p>

            <p>These cats tpyially come in a white or white grey-black colors. Very adorable cats who love to spend time with humans. If you ask me, this is the perfect beginner cat for people who are used to dogs.<p>
            <p>I really enjoy these cats. Every breed I've seen has accepted my pets. They are without a doubt the most extroverted cats in my eyes. One of them even fell asleep on me, and it was the first time I met it.</p>

                <h1>How to Train a Cat</h1>
                <p>Cats cat cool, but feral cats are CRAZY. So here is how you can tame them.</p>
                <h2>Asses the cat's comfort level</h2>
                <p>Watch the cat from a distance and see how easily spooked and aggersive it can get. out your safety first however</p>
                <h2>Make Safe and calming environment</h2>
                <p> find a quiet room you can store the cat. should have food water and a litter box. it is vital the room is peaceful and "zen"</p>
                <h2>Provide Regular, Consistent Meals</h2>
<p>Set a regular feeding schedule for the cat. Put the food in the same spot at the same time every day, but give the cat space to eat without pressure. The goal is to make the cat feel comfortable associating you with food.</p>

<h2>Let the Cat Approach You</h2>
<p>Once the cat is eating comfortably, sit quietly in the room at a safe distance. Let the cat come to you on its own terms, and avoid staring directly at it, as this can be intimidating. Slowly build trust through your calm presence.</p>

<h2>Gradual Human Interaction</h2>
<p>Over time, when the cat feels more comfortable, try extending your hand slowly to let the cat sniff you. Don’t rush; let the cat come to you when it’s ready. Offering treats can also encourage positive associations with you.</p>

<h2>Use a Calm, Soft Voice</h2>
<p>Speak in a gentle, soothing voice whenever you're near the cat. Avoid sudden movements or loud noises, as these can cause the cat to become more fearful.</p>

<h2>Increase Interaction Gradually</h2>
<p>Start by spending short, calm periods with the cat. Gradually increase your time together as the cat gets more comfortable. Play with toys, like a feather wand or string, from a safe distance to engage the cat in fun, positive interaction.</p>

<h2>Let the Cat Set the Pace</h2>
<p>Don’t rush the cat. Always allow the cat to approach you when it feels ready. If the cat seems frightened, back off and give it time to relax. Observe its body language to determine if it's comfortable.</p>

<h2>Be Patient and Give Time</h2>
<p>Remember, taming a feral cat takes time—sometimes weeks or even months. Don’t expect quick results. Celebrate small victories as you build trust with the cat.</p>

<h2>new pet!</h2>
<p>got a new cat now. that's pretty cool if you ask me</p>
