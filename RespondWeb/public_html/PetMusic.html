Takanaka is a must listen to.</p>
            <h3>Pets Owned</h3>
            <p>Unfortentatly, not much information is known about Takanaka's pet cats. Although it was clear he loved them very much. He wrote songs about them (<i>Dancing to Cat Guitar</i> and <i>I Remember Puckle</i>) and adored cats. His music was even released under <i>Kitty Records</i>! Thus, Takanaka was a huge fan of cats.</p>

            <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.</p>
